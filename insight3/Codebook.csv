Since data on tree cover gains are not available, the annual net loss cannot be calculated, thus the indicator is an estimate for gross permanent deforestation.",,"For this indicator, we calculated the annual loss of tree cover as the sum of losses driven by exploitation for commodity production, urbanization, shifting agriculture, forestry or wildfires, and the permanent loss of tree cover as the sum of losses driven by exploitation for commodity production, urbanization and 50% of losses due to shifting agriculture. We calculated the annual extent of tree cover by substracting the annual loss of tree cover from the overall tree cover in 2010, and divided annual permanent loss by annual tree cover. The final indicator value is the three-year average of this ratio for years 2015, 2018 and 2021. "
